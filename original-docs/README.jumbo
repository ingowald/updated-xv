This is the latest version of the XV jumbo patches I originally created in
February 2000 (but never distributed) and eventually updated and released in
May 2004, prompted by a discussion on LWN (http://lwn.net/Articles/76391/).
Information about the patches, updates to the patches, and the patches
themselves can all be found here:

	http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_xv.html
	http://freshmeat.net/projects/xvjumbopatches/

(Use the "Subscribe to new releases" link on the latter page if you want to
be notified of new versions automatically; trivial registration required.)

These patches incorporate all of the fix- and enhancement-patches available
from John's XV site (http://www.trilon.com/xv/downloads.html and
ftp://ftp.trilon.com/pub/xv/patches/), plus a number of my own fixes and
additions (security-related and otherwise), plus quite a few from other
people.  They're still not fully complete, and it's probable they never
will be, but I do plan to continue tinkering with them whenever the mood
strikes--and I may even release them publicly on rare occasions.  (At the
current rate, once every few years may be the best we can hope for....)

Also be aware that several other people have had the same idea over the
years.  Ones I've found, more or less by accident, include:

 - Landon Curt "chongo" Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)
   http://www.isthe.com/chongo/src/xv-patch/
 - Mark Ashley <mark ibiblio.org>
   http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/solaris/sparc/html/xv.3.10a.p19.html

 - Kyoichiro Suda <sudakyo fat.coara.or.jp>
   http://www.coara.or.jp/~sudakyo/XV_jp.html

This is not an exhaustive list (e.g., Jörgen Grahn also had one).  So far,
most of the other patch-sets appear not to be as extensive or as up-to-date
as my own, particularly now that the (very large) "Japanese extension" patches
are incorporated--big thanks to Werner Fink of SuSE for that!

Below I summarize the component patches that are encompassed by my jumbo
bugfixes and jumbo enhancements patches, circa 2005.  (As of 2007, they're
distributed as a single monster-patch, and the "component patches" are now
listed in the changelog section at the bottom of this file.)  Unfortunately,
some of my own additions never saw the light of day as standalone patches,
but considering the number of overlaps (collisions) already implicit in the
list, that would have been difficult to accomplish even if I'd had the time.

Here's a quick guide to the "third-party" credits in the lists and changelog
below:

Other credits are as listed on the XV Downloads page or in the respective

Finally, please note that these patches have not been blessed by John Bradley
in any way (although I copied him on the May 2004 announcement and wrote to
him again in May 2005), unless you count Debian's redistribution permission
(Daniel Kirchheimer, 5 Dec 2005).  Nor have I personally tested every change
and feature!  (See the BIG SCARY WARNING below for further caveats.)  In other
words, they're both completely unofficial and completely unguaranteed.  But
they seem to work for me.  (And when they don't, I try to fix 'em--eventually,
anyway... ;-) )

How to build
------------

The following assumes you, the user, already have the libtiff,[1] libjpeg,[2]
libpng,[3] zlib,[4] and JasPer[5] libraries downloaded, patched (if necessary),
compiled, and installed, not to mention a C compiler and the bzip2,[6] tar,[7]
patch,[8] and make[9] utilities.  You should also have downloaded the original
XV 3.10a source distribution from the XV Downloads page[10] and be able to edit
its Makefile and config.h files as indicated in the INSTALL file.  (Editing
the Makefile will also allow you to disable some of the third-party libraries
if you wish.)  Finally, you should know what a Unix(-style) command line is,
where to find one, and how to wield it with abandon (or at least with adult
supervision)--and preferably not as the root user until the "make install"
step.  (A filesystem is a terrible thing to waste.)

|                            BIG SCARY WARNING                            |
|                                                                         |
|  These patches work for Greg (and parts of them reportedly work for     |
|  various other people), and so far Greg's CPU still computes and his    |
|  hard disks haven't been wiped.  But there's no guarantee that this     |
|  will be the case for you! In particular, not every incorporated patch  |
|  has been explicitly tested, nor has every possible subcase of the      |
|  explicitly tested subset. (Read that again; it's grammatical.)  Nor    |
|  are these patches officially blessed by John Bradley in any way. In    |
|  other words, if you use these patches, you do so at your own risk.     |
|  (Greg doesn't believe there are any serious problems remaining, but    |
|  then, what programmer ever does? Bugs happen.)                         |
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Assuming you have the prerequisites out of the way and aren't scared
off by the Big Scary Warning, here's the build procedure:

      tar xvzf xv-3.10a-jumbo-patches-20070520.tar.gz
      (or:  gzip -dc xv-3.10a-jumbo-patches-20070520.tar.gz | tar xvf - )

      tar xvzf xv-3.10a.tar.gz 

      cd xv-3.10a 

      patch -p1 < ../xv-3.10a-jumbo-fix-enh-patch-20070520.txt 

      edit Makefile and config.h as directed in INSTALL file (in particular,
      ensure paths to external libraries and header files are correct)

      make 

      ./xv  your_favorite_image  your_other_favorite_image  etc.

If everything seems to be working to your satisfaction, go ahead and install: 

      make -n install (and double-check that things will be installed
      where you want them to be)

      become root if necessary (e.g., type su)

      make install 
      (or:  sudo make install)

That wasn't so hard, was it?

[!] Note that all six of these formats may still suffer from exploitable heap
    overflows [*SECURITY*] when decoding images with large (possibly invalid)
    dimensions; as a result, they are DISABLED by default.  (Search for "GRR
    POSSIBLE OVERFLOW / FIXME" comments in xvmag.c, xvmaki.c, xvpi.c, xvpic.c,
    xvpic2.c, and xvhips.c, but keep in mind that these may not be exhaustive.)
    Users who choose to overlook these security issues can enable any or all
    of them by editing config.h.

not finished (and/or even started ;-) ):

 - fix xvpng.c not to use direct struct access
 - (better) fix for never-ending pile of SLOW popups when viewing TIFFs with
   unknown tags (or truncated/corrupted images)
 - fix for minor .Z inefficiency in xv.c ("FIXME")
 - fix for filename entry-field mouse/cursor deficiencies
   (positioning fixed 20070104 by Ross Combs; would like select/cut/paste, too)
 - fix for .ppm.gz "disk leak" [can't reproduce...already fixed?]
   (maybe occurs only if filesystem is already nearly full?  bad .gz?)

 - transparency support for TIFF, XPM and TGA images
 - support for tiled background image (with transparent foreground image)
 - MNG/JNG support
 - SVG support
